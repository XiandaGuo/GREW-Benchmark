## GREW-BENCHMARCH

This repository contains the code for our ICCV 2021 paper `Gait Recognition in the Wild: A Benchmark` 

## Getting Started

- [Apply for and Download](docs/0.download_datasets.md) GREW datasets.
- [Decompress and Organize](docs/1.decompress&organize_datasets.md) GREW datasets.
- [Training and Testing](docs/2.training&testing.md) on GREW datasets.

## Acknowledgements

Part of the code is adopted from previous works: [GaitSet](https://github.com/AbnerHqC/GaitSet), We thank the original authors for their awesome repos.

Besides, some other attractive works extend the boundary of GREW.
