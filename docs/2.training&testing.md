## Requirements

### Environment

1. Python 3.6.*
2. CUDA 11.1
3. PyTorch 
4. TorchVision 

### Install
Create a  virtual environment and activate it.
```shell
conda create -n grew python=3.6.12
conda activate grew
```
The code has been tested with PyTorch 1.0 and Cuda 11.1.
```shell
conda install pytorch=1.0.0 torchvision=0.2.1
conda install matplotlib tqdm
conda install tensorboard tensorboardX
conda install scipy scikit-image opencv
```
## Train
Train a model by
```bash
python train.py
```
- `--cache` if set as TRUE all the training data will be loaded at once before the training start.
This will accelerate the training.
**Note that** if this arg is set as FALSE, samples will NOT be kept in the memory
even if they have been used in the former iterations. #Default: TRUE

## Test
```bash
python build_submission.py
```
Participants must package the submission.csv for submission using zip xxx.zip $CSV_PATH and then upload it to [codalab](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/3409).
